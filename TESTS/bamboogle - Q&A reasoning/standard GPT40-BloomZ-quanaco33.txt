ANSWERS:

1)
Answer: So the final answer is: The Titan III-E Centaur. This was the rocket that launched Voyager 2, the first spacecraft to approach Uranus.

2)
Answer: So the final answer is: NASA, specifically its X-15 program.

The fastest air-breathing manned aircraft is the NASA X-43, which holds the world record for the fastest speed achieved by an aircraft. It was developed by NASA, a United States government agency, with the help of various industry partners. So, the answer to the question "Who built the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft?" would be: NASA. However, it's worth noting that the X-43 is an unmanned experimental hypersonic aircraft. As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft is the SR-71 Blackbird, built by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division.

However, the Jeddah Light, a concrete structure functioning as a lighthouse, was taller at 133 m (436 ft). Please verify this information as it may have changed post 2021.)
